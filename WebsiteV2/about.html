        <p id="p-about"> A Flickr in Time shows the most popular images, by favorites, for each region given a tag, date, or both. The page opens up displaying the “World” with each continent showing the overall most popular image for that region. By clicking the a continent, the user is brought to the top images for the countries of that region. If a country is clicked then the top images for the country are displayed. When any node is hovered over it gives details such as the title, user, date taken, and description for the given image. If nothin appear, it's not broken, it simply means that there were no images for that region,tag, and/or date. Try to keep searching!</p>

        <p id="p-about">Each layer can also be filtered by tags or dates, so the user can see and compare the most popular image for a given tag or date between countries, regions, or continents. The idea is to see the differences and similarities between cultures across the world. Photos allow us to have a visual representation of different people or places. Seeing an image of a birthday celebrated in Canada juxtaposed against a image of an individual celebrating a birthday in India can spark a dialogue about how we see others who we might consider different than ourselves. While not all images make for interesting comparisons, the program is fluid, dynamic, and easy to navigate. </p>
